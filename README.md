Please read the report1GeneralAnalysis file before the report1EpochAnalysis file. This will provide a small but useful amount of context about what I am trying to do/analyze.

# Report1GeneralAnalysis.ipynb

In this file I will explore the Game Of Thrones text (the books, not the movie script) using a CBOW and skip-gram model. I perform a variety of tests on these models in order to try and identify strengths and weaknesses between them

# Report1EpochAnalysis.ipynb

In this file I will explore the relationship betwen increase the number of epochs used in training with the cosine similarity score of a pair of words. I again use the Game Of Thrones text and perform some basic analysis to try and identify a relationship between number of epochs and the cosine similarity score of word pairs.
